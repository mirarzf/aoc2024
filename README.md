# Advent of Code 2024
My C++ wannabe and Python solutions for the advent of code 2024. 
Link of AoC 2024 puzzles here: [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024/)

## How to use this repository? 
This repository is mainly personal as I am learning while solving the daily puzzles from AoC 2024. You can use the solutions in this repository for comparison. 
In order to do so, you can look at the [C++ solutions](#c-solutions) or the [Python solutions](#python-solutions). 
To make the different solutions work, don't forget to put your input in the input folder with the name `day02.txt` if your input is for the puzzle of day 2. (The input texts that are already present are simple copy/paste of my own inputs.)

## C++ Solutions 
The C++ solutions are available in the folder `cppsolutions`. The code for each solution is available in the folder corresponding to the day. 

## Python Solutions 
The Python solutions are available in the folder `pysolutions`. The code for each solution is available in the folder corresponding to the day. Each `solve` function for each day corresponds to 
the main solving function of the day. 

Use the following command prompt to obtain the solution of problem day 1. 
```
python solve.py 1 
``` 
You can also specify the part (1 or 2) of a problem if you don't want all of the answers revealed. 
```
python solve.py 1 -p 1
``` 
You can also specify the input .TXT file if it's in the input folder. 
```
python solve.py 1 -i text.txt
python solve.py 1 -i day01.txt
```
